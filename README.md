# Development of an Automated Text-to-Speech Device for Visually Impaired
## Overview:-

This project involves the development of a text-to-speech system using a Raspberry Pi 4, a Pi Camera module 3, and Google Cloud services.

The system is designed to capture an image containing text, extract the text using OCR technology, translate the text to a desired language using the Google Translate, and generate speech from the translated text using the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API.

The project aims to address the issue of language barriers, allowing users to capture images containing text in any language and receive spoken translations in their desired language. 

The project's use of OCR technology and cloud-based translation services ensures high accuracy and quality in the translation process. 

The Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API's lifelike intonation, rhythm, and pacing create natural-sounding speech, making the system highly effective in facilitating communication.

The project's efficient and user-friendly design makes it an ideal tool for various applications, including education, language learning, and accessibility for individuals with visual impairments.

The project's use of a Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi Camera module 3 makes it portable and accessible for users in various settings.

Overall, this project demonstrates the significant impact that technology can have on breaking down language barriers and facilitating communication and access to information for individuals worldwide.

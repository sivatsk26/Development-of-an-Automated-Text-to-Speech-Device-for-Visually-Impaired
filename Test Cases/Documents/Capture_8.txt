I am so mad at myself. I feel like
I hate myself instead of hating you
and I don't know if that's possible.
Because I convinced myself I was over you
and now I know it was all pretend.
I pretended that I didn't look at you
when you didn't notice I was.
I pretended not to light up
when you entered a room.
I pretended not to be upset
when we got in a fight.
I pretended I didn't look forward
to seeing you everyday.
I pretended that I wasn't hurt
when you broke my heart.
I pretended I didn't miss you
when you didn't come around.
Now all these lies have showed me is that
I miss you so much more than I had realized.
